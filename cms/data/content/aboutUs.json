  "intro": "International Missionary Fellowship is a Christian based, non denominational 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that strives to share the love and compassion of our Lord through service to the people of Bombardopolis Haiti. Our main ministry is the administration, supplying and funding of Hospital Evangelique Bombardopolis (HEB), the only hospital that serves the 50,000 people in the region. We also minister to their physical and spiritual needs as well with programs ranging from food and water to the need to hear and learn about Christ Jesus.",
  "history": {
    "description": "IMF had its beginnings in the 1970’s in Jamaica where Tom Northen our founder had an established missionary effort underway. After a providential trip to northwest Haiti and Bombardoplis the mission migrated to that region and has been there ever since. The Lord has grown the hospital from its simple beginnings to a well run hospital providing continuous quality health care to the people in the region and we are continuing to grow. HEB has recently been cited and recognized by the Haitian Health Department as the best run mixed institution in the northwest region and Haiti. Not only is HEB providing top notch health care it is also one of the largest employers in the area. With the exception of the director, all positions are staffed by Haitians, from the doctors to the guards.",
