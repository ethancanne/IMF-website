            We serve a population of about 50,000 in Bombardopolis, a remote
            area of Northwest Haiti that is notoriously poor and unsettled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our challenges are practical as well as spiritual, yet we endeavor
            to show the love of God as we meet basic needs of people in Jesusâ€™
            name. For 50 years we have been the only consistent source of
            healthcare in the area.
